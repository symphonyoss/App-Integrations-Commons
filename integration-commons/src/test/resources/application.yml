#
# Indicate the Integration Bridge domain, host and port.
# Integration Bridge will only serve at localhost though HTTP, therefore
# a proxy must be configured to set up the required SSL context for the
# Integration Bridge.
#
# The Integration Bridge host is used to provision the required paths for the
# apps and webhooks and must be accessible on port 443 through the Integration
# Bridge proxy.
#
# The Trust Store file, type, and password are optional and must be used only if there is
# a custom truststore to connect to keymanager, agent and POD. If you are installing your
# Integration Bridge as a Symphony managed cloud server you will not need a truststore.
# If the key manager is hosted in a VPC, meaning it is part of a separate domain, then
# a truststore will be required.
#
# For a deployment using a custom Trust Store, uncomment both truststore_file and
# truststore_type and define the file and type for the custom Trust Store.
# Some integrations may need to access external services to gather data and enrich
# the incoming webhook notification with further information. Ideally, the custom
# truststore should be based on the Java CA Certificates store (plus the required
# custom certificates), so that the Integration Bridge will be abe to establish HTTPS
# connections with any external services. As an alternative, the required external
# services certificates could be added to a custom Trust Store, created from scratch
# with the custom certificates.
#
# To maintain the security of the system, we will need to check for the origination
# of webhooks to make sure that all webhooks coming in are validated and not spoofs.
#
# If you want to make this check you should uncomment the allowed_origins section
# and define the list of trusted origins. It's a global list used by all the applications
# and contains the origin host name, IP address or both. The IP address can be a range
# using CIDR notation.
#
# The global list of allowed_origins is an additional list to the application-specific
# allowed_origins list (see below the applications sections of the yaml file).

# This is the list of applications to be provisioned on the POD and Integration
# Bridge. Each app entry indicates the deployment state of the application, its
# configuration on Symphony application store, and the keystore information.
#
# If "state" is "REMOVED", the application will be removed from the Integration
# Bridge host and the "enabled"/"visible" flags will be set to false at
# Symphony application store.
#
# If "state" is "PROVISIONED", the application will be deployed on the
# Integration Bridge host, it will be available at Symphony Application store
# and its Bot user will also be provisioned on the system, with the
# corresponding certificates.
#
# If "state" is "PROVISIONED", the "enabled" and "visible" flags will be set
# accordingly at Symphony application store to control wheter the application
# is actually enabled on the system and visible to users at Symphony Market.
#
# The "keystore" fields define the application certificate information as the filename, password and type.
# All the certificate files must be in the certs directory.
#
# If you want to check for the origination of webhook you should uncomment the allowed_origins
# section and define the list of trusted origins. You can define a local whitelist for
# each application.
